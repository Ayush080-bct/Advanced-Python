res = cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master")
res.fetchone()
Output:

bash
Copy code
('students',)
Step 1: What is sqlite_master?
sqlite_master is a special table in every SQLite database.

It stores metadata about your database objects:

Tables

Indexes

Views

Triggers

Think of it as the database’s table of contents.

Columns of sqlite_master include:

type → 'table', 'index', etc.

name → the object name

tbl_name → table the object belongs to

sql → the SQL used to create it

Step 2: Your query
sql
Copy code
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
You are asking SQLite:

“Give me the name of all database objects.”

cursor.execute() returns a cursor object itself (here stored in res).

Step 3: Fetching the first row
python
Copy code
res.fetchone()
fetchone() returns the next row from the result set.

Each row is a tuple, even if it has only one column.

That’s why you see:

bash
Copy code
('students',)
✅ Meaning: The first object in your database is a table named students.

Step 4: If you want all rows
python
Copy code
res.fetchall()
Returns a list of tuples for all objects:

python
Copy code
[('students',), ('teachers',), ...]
Quick tips:
The comma inside ('students',) is Python’s way of saying it’s a tuple.

If you want just the string:

python
Copy code
row = res.fetchone()
print(row[0])  # prints: students
Example:
python
Copy code
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("school.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (id INTEGER, name TEXT)")
conn.commit()

# List all objects
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())






Step 1: What is sqlite_master?

sqlite_master stores all objects in your database: tables, indexes, views, triggers.

Its name column contains the names of these objects — not the columns inside tables, only the table/index/view names.

Step 2: What you queried
SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE name='age'


You asked SQLite:

“Give me the object in the database whose name is 'age'”

Question: Does your database have a table (or index, etc.) named age?

If not → SQLite returns nothing, i.e., None in Python.

Step 3: Why you got None

fetchone() returns the first row of results.

If the query returns no rows, Python returns None.

So your database likely has no table or object named age.

Step 4: How to see column names instead of table names

If you want to check columns of a table, you cannot use sqlite_master the way you did.

Example for table students:

cursor.execute("PRAGMA table_info(students)")
columns = cursor.fetchall()
print(columns)


Output might look like:

[(0, 'id', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 1), (1, 'name', 'TEXT', 0, None, 0), (2, 'age', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 0)]


Column 1 ('name') in the tuple is the column name

Now you can see if your table has a c
